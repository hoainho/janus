# Changelog

## 2026-06-09 - Post-Merge Automation

- Added post-merge changelog automation for merged pull requests.
- Added conditional Harness CLI patch release automation when merged PRs change Rust CLI source, schema, Cargo metadata, or release packaging files.
- Reused the existing Harness CLI release workflow for release builds so tag, manual, and post-merge releases share the same verification and asset publishing path.
